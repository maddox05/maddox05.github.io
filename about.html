            Hi! I'm Maddox. I've been coding for about 5 years now and its
            always enticed me. I never exactly knew why I wanted to do x
            profession in life, but after reflecting I see it. I want to work on
            something that I will benefit me outside of work. So it makes sense
            that I'm doing computer science, while working you can learn things
            to go back and make personal projects. I've always found it fun
            working on personal projects, like my first project, making a rust
            script that combatted the recoil, where I would play the game a bit
            and in the downtime I would code. It was so fun to me seeing my
            script work, and then seeing my friends used it made it so much
            better. I don't want to go to work for the rest of my life for
            someone else working on something I don't want, I want to do
            something great. For some more things about me, I enjoy mountain
            biking, hiking with my girlfriend, and coding. Currently I'm in
            school for Computer Science at Purdue.
