        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I've been coding for about 5 years now and it has always enticed me. I
          want to work on something that will benefit me outside of work. That's
          why I'm pursuing computer science at Purdue - while working you can
          learn things to go back and make personal projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I've always found it fun working on personal projects, like my first
          project, making a rust script that combatted recoil. It was so fun
          seeing my script work, and seeing my friends use it made it even
          better.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I don't want to work for someone else on something I don't care about.
          I want to do something great.

        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          This website serves as my personal portfolio and blog. Here you'll
          find my projects, thoughts on software development, and a glimpse into
          my life outside of coding. I built this site from scratch to showcase
          my work and share my journey as a developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The site features a neo-brutalist design aesthetic with bold typography,
          high-contrast colors, and interactive elements. Every piece of it was
          hand-coded by me.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I'm passionate about the outdoors and staying active.
          You'll often find me mountain biking on trails, hiking with my
          girlfriend, playing soccer, or at the shooting range. I believe
          balancing screen time with outdoor activities makes me a better
          developer and a happier person.
