        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          DuckMath started in October 2021 when I was 16 years old, a junior at
          Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis. I saw someone
          younger than me on TikTok who had built an unblocked games site and
          thought "I can do that." The thing is, I had barely coded before. But I
          started anyway.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What began as a simple unblocked games site turned into a platform
          hosting 250+ browser-based games across categories like Multiplayer,
          Flash, Emulator, Platformer, Puzzle, Sports, and more. The whole point
          was simple: give students a way to play games at school when everything
          else was blocked.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I worked on it 5-30 minutes a day for years. No grand plan, no
          investors, no team. Just me, iterating constantly, learning by doing.
          As I like to say: "I learned through doing mostly."

        <h2>The $240 Day</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          For three years DuckMath grew slowly. I'd tweak the design, add games,
          fix things that broke. Then in December 2024, the site earned $240 in a
          single day. That was the moment everything changed. I was working an
          internship at the time and I realized this little side project had more
          potential than I'd ever given it credit for. I left the internship and
          went all-in.

        <h2>The Marketing Machine</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Growth didn't happen by accident. I built a content machine: 12
          short-form videos per day across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram
          Reels, and Snapchat. I used an auto-upload platform to distribute
          content simultaneously across all platforms. The formula was simple -
          videos like "how to play X game in school" with DuckMath as the
          answer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I constantly analyzed what content hit and iterated on the formula. The
          result? In August 2025, the site went from 5,000 to 150,000 daily
          active users in just two weeks.
        </p>

          From 1,828 views on my first ever TikTok to 1.7 million views on a
          single video. SEO was massive too - Google Search Console showed 1.34
          million clicks, 3.18 million impressions, and a 42.2% click-through
          rate.

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          DuckMath was intentionally simple. The entire site was HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript hosted on GitHub Pages. Games were delivered as browser-based
          HTML5, Flash emulation, and WebGL. I owned 20+ domains as backups so
          if one got blocked by a school, students could just go to another. The
          site also had cloaking tools and proxy integration to bypass filters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On top of the games, I built a leaderboard system, an in-site economy
          with coins, a seasonal battle pass, and a Discord proxy. Revenue came
          from ads - minimal and non-intrusive, but at 150k daily users it
          added up fast.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The kicker? A full rebuild of the entire site would take me 3-4 days.
          Simple tech, massive distribution.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>The Exit</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In November 2025, FreezeNova - a global gaming company that had
          previously acquired similar sites - reached out. They offered $100K. I
          countered with $120K. They agreed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the time DuckMath was pulling $15,000-$20,000 per month in ad
          revenue. Selling wasn't about the money running out - it was about
          wanting to move on. The unblocked games space wasn't where I wanted to
          build long-term. I had bigger ideas.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The sale was covered by the Purdue Exponent, Inside Indiana Business,
          Fox 4 KC, WLFI, and YouAreCurrent. Not bad for something I started as
          a 16-year-old who could barely code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          DuckMath taught me that distribution beats product. The tech was
          simple. What made it work was relentless marketing, understanding my
          audience (students on school Chromebooks), and solving a real problem
          they had every day.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It also taught me that consistency compounds. Three years of 5-30
          minutes a day doesn't feel like much in the moment, but it adds up to
          something real. When the viral moment came, I was ready because I'd
          spent years quietly building the foundation.
