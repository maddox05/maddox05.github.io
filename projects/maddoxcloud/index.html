        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          After selling DuckMath for $120K, I knew the next thing had to be
          bigger. DuckMath taught me that students on school Chromebooks are an
          underserved audience with real demand. The problem was that browser
          games only go so far - students wanted to play real games like Roblox,
          Clash Royale, and Toca Boca, but those require native apps that school
          Chromebooks can't install.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The solution: stream the games from the cloud. Run Android games on
          remote servers and pipe the video to any browser. No downloads, no
          installs, no hardware requirements. That's MaddoxCloud.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I built it in about a month of 10-hour days and officially launched in
          December 2025.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          MaddoxCloud runs Android emulator instances on remote servers. When a
          user picks a game, the server launches an Android instance with that
          game, captures the video and audio output, and streams it to the
          user's browser in real-time via WebRTC. The user's keyboard, mouse, and
          touch inputs get relayed back to the server, so it feels like the game
          is running locally.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The result: you can play Roblox, Clash Royale, or any Android game on
          a school Chromebook, a crappy laptop, or even a phone browser. All you
          need is an internet connection.

        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The infrastructure behind MaddoxCloud is the most complex thing I've
          built. Here's what powers it:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Streaming:</strong> WebRTC for low-latency video/audio
            streaming from server to browser and input relay back
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Android Emulation:</strong> Server-side Android emulator
            instances running game APKs on cloud compute
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CDN/Security:</strong> Cloudflare for DDoS protection,
            caching, and global distribution
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong> Web application served through the browser
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SSL:</strong> Google Trust Services, domain validated
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          The hardest part isn't the code - it's the infrastructure scaling.
          Each user needs their own Android instance running on a server, which
          means compute costs scale linearly with users. That's the challenge
          I'm working on solving right now.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>The Business Model</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          MaddoxCloud runs on a freemium model. Free users get 10-minute play
          sessions and wait in a queue when servers are at capacity. Paid users
          get unlimited play time with no waitlist.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The waitlist has been both a blessing and a curse. At peak times,
          queues hit 12,000+ people. That's incredible demand validation, but
          it also means users get frustrated waiting. The long-term plan is to
          make the platform fully free once I figure out the infrastructure
          scaling and can bring costs down enough.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I applied the same playbook from DuckMath: aggressive short-form video
          across every platform. TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, Instagram
          Reels. The content targets the same audience - students who want to
          play games on their school Chromebooks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One Snapchat post - "Schools tried to ban maddoxcloud.com so I did 15
          jumping jacks, destroyed their firewall, and now I'm back in" - pulled
          357 likes and showed the kind of viral, relatable content that
          resonates with students. When schools block the domain, that just
          becomes more content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          MaddoxCloud is still early. Two months in with 50K users and $500 MRR
          is solid, but the real challenge is scaling the infrastructure to
          handle demand without burning through cash. I'm working on:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>Reducing server costs per user session</li>
          <li>Improving stream quality and reducing latency</li>
          <li>Expanding the game library</li>
          <li>Eventually making the entire platform free</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          DuckMath proved I could build something millions of people use.
          MaddoxCloud is the next step - harder tech, harder scaling, but a
          much bigger opportunity.
