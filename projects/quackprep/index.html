        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          QuackPrep came from a problem I experienced firsthand as a Purdue
          student. Studying for exams sucks. You're digging through random
          Google results trying to find past exams, paying for Chegg or Quizlet
          Premium, and still not sure if you're studying the right material for
          your specific class at your specific school.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I wanted to build something that solved this for real. A platform where
          students could find free past exams and study materials filtered by
          their exact college and course. No paywalls, no premium tiers, no BS.
          Just free study tools that actually help.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I launched QuackPrep in July 2024 under the OpenExams organization on
          GitHub. It's fully open source.

        <h2>What It Does</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          QuackPrep has a few core features that make it different from what's
          already out there:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Past Exam Library:</strong> A searchable archive of real
            college exams, filtered by school. No more Googling "Purdue CS 180
            past exams" and hoping for the best.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>School-Specific Filtering:</strong> Enter your university
            and get tailored materials. No irrelevant content from other schools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI Study Tools:</strong> AI that identifies your weak areas
            and generates custom quizzes targeting the stuff you actually need to
            work on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spaced Repetition Flashcards:</strong> Cards that
            auto-schedule reviews based on your performance, so you study right
            before you're about to forget something.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community-Driven:</strong> Students upload their own past
            exams and materials to help future students. Pay it forward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          And it's all completely free. No freemium model, no hidden paywalls.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          QuackPrep is the most "proper" codebase I've built. It has a real
          backend, a real database, tests, CI/CD - the whole thing. Here's what
          powers it:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend:</strong> React + Redux for state management, with
            Semantic UI components
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js + Express
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database:</strong> MySQL 8.0+
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing:</strong> Playwright for end-to-end tests
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validation:</strong> Zod for input validation on the backend
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>License:</strong> GPL-3.0 (fully open source)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project uses a monorepo structure with separated frontend and
          backend directories. Models contain business logic, routes handle API
          endpoints, and the folder structure mirrors the API endpoints for
          intuitive navigation. All API calls go through a standardApiCall
          middleware.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'll be honest - the frontend is the weakest part. It works, but it's
          not my proudest code. The backend architecture is where I'm most happy
          with how things turned out.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Why Open Source</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Most study platforms are closed-source and locked behind paywalls.
          Chegg charges $15/month. Quizlet locked their best features behind
          Quizlet Plus. CourseHero wants $40/month.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Students are already broke. They shouldn't have to pay to study. Making
          QuackPrep open source and free means anyone can use it, anyone can
          contribute to it, and if I stop working on it tomorrow, someone else
          can fork it and keep going.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The GitHub repo has 740+ commits and 25 open issues, with a couple
          marked as "good first issue" for anyone who wants to contribute.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>The $20 Revenue</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yeah, QuackPrep has made $20. Total. And I think that's fine.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Not every project needs to be a money machine. DuckMath made $150K/year
          and got acquired. MaddoxCloud is growing its MRR. QuackPrep is the
          project I built because I genuinely wanted it to exist. Sometimes you
          build things because they should exist, not because they'll make you
          rich.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That said, if 200+ college students are finding it useful, that's a
          win. Every exam they pass a little easier because they found the right
          study material - that's the point.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          QuackPrep taught me how to build a real full-stack application. Not a
          static site, not a game wrapper - a proper app with user
          authentication, database operations, API design, testing, and CI/CD.
          It was the project that leveled up my engineering skills the most.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It also taught me that building for users is different from building
          for myself. Understanding how students actually study, what information
          they need and when, and how to make the experience frictionless - that
          product thinking is something you only learn by shipping and watching
          people use your stuff.
